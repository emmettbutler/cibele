voc_firstconvo 1 Nina: Hey, what's up?
voc_firstconvo 3193 Ichi: Let's just private chat. I'm sick of all these fuckers in the main channel.
voc_firstconvo 7131 Nina: [laughs] Yeah, everyone's pretty rowdy today.
voc_firstconvo 12025 Ichi: They're all spazzing because Bulldog Hell is coming out tonight.
voc_firstconvo 15734 Ichi: They're gonna go line up at whatever store, which fucking sucks because now we can't do anything serious tonight.
voc_firstconvo 20972 Nina: Uhhh, yeaahhh...
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 1 Nina: I'm so not photogenic...
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 2291 Ichi: You definitely are! I'm not photogenic - I look like a fuckin' ghost!
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 6455 Ichi: [laughs] I thought you looked really nice in that photo you posted.
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 11276 Ichi: You don't have to lie. I'll still like you even if you admit that I look like a ghost.
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 15220 Nina: [laughs] No...
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 17372 Ichi: Yes! Come on, have you seen Guil? He's like a fuckin' bodybuilder!
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 21495 Nina: [laughs] ...yeah...
voc_extra_areyoucoming 1 Ichi: Are you coming?
voc_ikuturso_picture 1 Ichi: Sooo...how about that picture?
voc_ikuturso_picture 3987 Nina: [sigh] y-yeah... Yeah, I can send you one if you want. I'll have to take it first though.
voc_ikuturso_picture 13599 Ichi: Okay!
voc_ikuturso_start 1 Nina: Yeah! Final boss in Iku Turso?
voc_ikuturso_start 3048 Nina: You're...really obsessed with that zone lately.
voc_ikuturso_start 6634 Ichi: [laughs] Coral gyre, yo!
voc_ikuturso_start 9403 Nina: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. My coral gyre's pretty good.
voc_ikuturso_start 14903 Ichi: Yup! I mean, if there's somewhere else you'd rather go, that's cool too.
voc_ikuturso_start 19307 Nina: Aw, that's nice. It's ok though, I like helping you.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 1 Nina: Ugh, yeah... I never know what to wear when I take pictures of myself, though. I get so self-conscious.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 9459 Ichi: You could literally wear anything and I'll probably still like the picture.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 13162 Nina: [nervous laugh] Really? I mean, not *anything*...
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 16960 Ichi: Seriously.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 19838 Nina: Okay. That last one was just of me standing there, so maybe I'll take more of a close-up this time.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 28589 Ichi: Yes please.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 1 Nina: You've been leading this ampule since it started, right?
voc_ikuturso_ampule 4907 Ichi: No, some other dude was, but he quit... and he was crap anyways. We didn't become good until I whooped everyone's ass into shape.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 13512 Nina: People really do listen to you. It's kind of amazing.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 18268 Ichi: I'm just really straightforward. Like, if people don't listen to me and then they fuck up, I make sure that they know they fucked up. You gotta get in people's faces. That's why they respect me.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 31025 Nina: Haha, I'm glad I haven't messed up that bad yet.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 36913 Ichi: Hah, I'm never gonna yell at you... uh, but still, don't be an idiot.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 42197 Nina: You... wouldn't yell at me?
voc_ikuturso_ampule 44915 Ichi: No!
voc_ikuturso_ampule 46198 Nina: Really?
voc_ikuturso_ampule 47481 Ichi: I'm not gonna yell at a cute girl.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 46198 Nina: [laughs]
voc_ikuturso_ampule 52237 Nina: I'm not cute...
voc_ikuturso_ampule 53671 Ichi: Pfft!
voc_ikuturso_ampule 56691 Nina: Hah, I don't think I am, but that's really nice of you.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 60767 Ichi: Hey, I know what you look like! You've posted a picture of yourself on the forums.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 66277 Nina: I mean, I know. That's a pretty flattering photo though.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 71863 Ichi: You should... send me a different picture, then I can I really decide if I think you're cute!
voc_ikuturso_ampule 76770 Nina: [laughs] Yeaaah...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 1 Nina: I don't know. He's like, attractive... but not really my type, you know?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 6454 Ichi: I don't know, dudes got pecs!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 9561 Nina: [laughs] Ew...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 12722 Nina: I like when guys are more... lean.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 16945 Ichi: Skinny dudes?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 18857 Ichi: I guess I fit that profile.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 20902 Nina: [laughs] I guess so.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 25957 Nina: Hmm...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 28525 Nina: What do you like?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 30437 Ichi: About girls?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 32376 Nina: Yeah.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 34607 Ichi: I... I like... uh, curvy, skinny girls... not like, fat girls. I just like it when they're not like, rail thin, you know? Girls gotta have some meat.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 45070 Nina: [laughs] hmm...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 50937 Nina: I wish I was skinnier.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 53159 Ichi: No way, you'd lose your boobs!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 54937 Nina: [laughs] Uh, I guess so??
voc_ikuturso_attractive 58670 Ichi: Seriously, you have to know that you've got a nice rack - come on!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 62315 Nina: [laughs] I mean, people have told me that before, but -
voc_ikuturso_attractive 68538 Ichi: As they should.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 70493 Nina: [nervous laugh]
voc_ikuturso_attractive 74583 Ichi: Aw, don't know how to take a compliment?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 77338 Nina: [laughs] I really dont.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 80539 Ichi: I'm gonna just have to keep giving you compliments until you get used to it.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 84717 Nina: [laughs] That'd be completely impossible, honestly - but you can give it a shot.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 92539 Ichi: Done!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 93606 Nina: Deal.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 95437 [both laugh]
voc_ikuturso_attractive 98851 Nina: This is the silliest. What are we even doing right now?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 103118 Ichi: Being friends and whacking stuff online.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 106496 Nina: [laughs] True story...
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 1 Ichi: [laughs] Guess you don't want to go waste your money on "Bullshit Hell" tonight?
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 4929 Nina: [laughs] Very funny. I barely even play other games anymore, honestly.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 11700 Ichi: Me neither - they're all crap anyways.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 14787 Nina: It - makes me kind of sad though... I like playing through good story games.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 20038 Ichi: I dunno, those are boring to me. They all have expiration dates - you play for sixty hours and that's it.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 25980 Ichi: At least with this game you can play it for a long time without worrying that you'll have to find some new shit to buy.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 31508 Nina: Yeah, I mean, the time you get out of an online game like this is a lot more...and you get to meet people.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 40767 Ichi: Yeah, I don't like most of the people I meet in here, though. Except for, like, you and a few others.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 47078 Ichi: I just like running shit - like making people get organized for some fight or whatever.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 51638 Ichi: The big battles where everything's dependent on your ability to find the right guys to do the job - that's what I like.
voc_euryale_hey 1 Ichi: Heeeeeyy!
voc_euryale_hey 1958 Nina: [sigh] Sorry I missed your call last night.
voc_euryale_hey 5600 Ichi: It's ok.
voc_euryale_teleport 1 Nina: We haven't done Euryale together in a while.
voc_euryale_teleport 3873 Ichi: Yeah, I hate it. All the crystals - it's like some fuckin' Final Fantasy game.
voc_euryale_teleport 9727 Nina: [laughs] I kinda like it actually. Wanna do a run together?
voc_euryale_teleport 15695 Ichi: Yeah.
voc_euryale_teleport 19860 Ichi: What happened yesterday?
voc_euryale_teleport 21999 Nina: When I logged off? Some school friends wanted to hang out.
voc_euryale_teleport 27741 Ichi: Lame.
voc_euryale_breakups 1 Nina: They basically wanted to gossip about poetry class and their recent breakups. It took forever.
voc_euryale_breakups 7876 Ichi: Wow.
voc_euryale_breakups 11581 Ichi: Breakups sound shitty.
voc_euryale_breakups 13550 Nina: Yeah... I've never even had a boyfriend.
voc_euryale_breakups 20525 Ichi: Seriously?
voc_euryale_breakups 22427 Nina: Yup.
voc_euryale_breakups 24263 Ichi: You're so hot though!
voc_euryale_breakups 25932 Nina: [laughs] You always say that.
voc_euryale_breakups 29369 Ichi: It's true!
voc_euryale_breakups 30771 Nina: You're, like, the only guy on earth that thinks I'm hot.
voc_euryale_breakups 34976 Ichi: Looks like I've got no competition then.
voc_euryale_breakups 37346 [both laugh]
voc_euryale_nada 1 Nina: What about your breakups?
voc_euryale_nada 4602 Ichi: Nada.
voc_euryale_nada 6931 Nina: Nada?
voc_euryale_nada 9021 Ichi: I've never had a girlfriend.
voc_euryale_nada 11125 Nina: Wow, I'm pretty suprised.
voc_euryale_nada 13721 Ichi: Don't be - I'm a total loser.
voc_euryale_nada 15938 Nina: Pfft, no.
voc_euryale_crush 1000 Nina: I think I would've had a huge crush on you if we'd met sooner, honestly. In, like, high school or whatever.
voc_euryale_crush 8110 Ichi: [laughs] Yeah?
voc_euryale_crush 11389 Nina: No guys ever liked me back then. I was too nerdy.
voc_euryale_crush 16285 Ichi: Well they had no taste. I would've totally been all over you.
voc_euryale_crush 20124 Nina: [laughs] I doubt that.
voc_euryale_callmeblake 1 Nina: Ichi -
voc_euryale_callmeblake 1953 Ichi: Call me Blake.
voc_euryale_callmeblake 3495 Nina: Blake?
voc_euryale_callmeblake 7023 Nina: Do you think I did good in Iku Turso the other day?
voc_euryale_callmeblake 10621 Blake: Nina, you did good.
voc_euryale_callmeblake 13978 Blake: Why do you always ask me if you're good at the game? You're way better than other girls in the ampule.
voc_euryale_callmeblake 19151 Nina: Oh! [laughs nervously]
voc_euryale_callmeblake 22646 Blake: You're a pro.
voc_euryale_callmeblake 24153 Nina: I'm not that great.
voc_euryale_callmeblake 26723 Blake: You're sexy and smart - the perfect combo.
voc_euryale_callmeblake 30697 Nina: [gasps] Do you...talk to anyone else offline like this?
voc_euryale_callmeblake 38817 Blake: No, do you?
voc_euryale_callmeblake 41660 Nina: No.
voc_euryale_closer 1451 Nina: I kinda wish we lived closer.
voc_euryale_closer 4529 Blake: Yeah, being on opposite coasts isn't the best for hanging out.
voc_euryale_meetup 1 Nina: Would you...want to meet up with me?
voc_euryale_meetup 4057 Nina: Like, in real life, if we lived closer.
voc_euryale_meetup 11301 Blake: I think so.
voc_euryale_meetup 14894 Blake: But if you were on Pacific time, you wouldn't always be online when I woke up. I like chatting with you first thing.
voc_euryale_meetup 21268 Nina: [laughs] aw. I bet you have so many people in the game to talk to though.
voc_euryale_meetup 26542 Blake: They're all fuckin' idiots.
voc_euryale_meetup 28164 Nina: [laughs] You always say that, but I feel like Lenore is way cooler than me.
voc_euryale_meetup 34481 Blake: Nina. Have you ever seen her picture?
voc_euryale_meetup 38016 Nina: No...why?
voc_euryale_meetup 41551 Blake: She...sent me one the other day.
voc_euryale_meetup 45550 Nina: Oh, really?
voc_euryale_meetup 51287 Blake: Your face is way nicer.
voc_euryale_meetup 53315 Nina: [laughs] My face is pretty normal.
voc_euryale_meetup 53315 Blake: If by normal you mean gorgeous, then yeah.
voc_euryale_meetup 60965 Nina: [laughs] Thanks.
voc_euryale_meetup 64558 Blake: Isn't your mom a model or something?
voc_euryale_meetup 67340 Nina: That's true, she was. I look more like my dad though.
voc_euryale_meetup 72092 Blake: Oh yeah?
voc_euryale_parents 1 Nina: Yeah, my parents met on the beach.
voc_euryale_parents 4706 Blake: Sounds sweet.
voc_euryale_parents 5951 Nina: [laughs] It's ridiculous.
voc_euryale_parents 8207 Nina: My mom was walking down the beach in her red bikini when my dad saw her from his boat.
voc_euryale_parents 12991 Nina: I guess he was like, "whoa, check out that babe", so he left his friends and swam in to talk to her.
voc_euryale_parents 19875 Blake: What a dude!
voc_euryale_parents 21003 Nina: I know. He asked her out on a date.
voc_euryale_parents 23804 Nina: She was really impressed that he swam all the way in from his boat to say hello, so she said, "ok".
voc_euryale_parents 30533 Blake: That's a pretty crazy story.
voc_euryale_parents 32983 Nina: Isn't it?
voc_euryale_parents 34539 Blake: I'm not nearly on that level with girls.
voc_euryale_parents 38273 Blake: I'm shit at talking to people in general.
voc_euryale_parents 40840 Nina: Really? You're so good with people in the game, though.
voc_euryale_parents 45002 Blake: Yeah, it's easier to talk when you're not looking at someone.
