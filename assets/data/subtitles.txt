voc_ikuturso_photogenic 1 Nina: I'm so not photogenic...
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 2291 Ichi: You definitely are! I'm not photogenic - I look like a fuckin' ghost!
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 6455 Ichi: [laughs] I thought you looked really nice in that photo you posted.
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 11276 Ichi: You don't have to lie. I'll still like you even if you admit that I look like a ghost.
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 15220 Nina: [laughs] No...
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 17372 Ichi: Yes! Come on, have you seen Guil? He's like a fuckin' bodybuilder!
voc_ikuturso_photogenic 21495 Nina: [laughs] ...yeah...
voc_extra_areyoucoming 1 Ichi: Are you coming?
voc_ikuturso_picture 1 Ichi: Sooo...how about that picture?
voc_ikuturso_picture 3987 Nina: [sigh] y-yeah... Yeah, I can send you one if you want. I'll have to take it first though.
voc_ikuturso_picture 13599 Ichi: Okay!
voc_ikuturso_start 1 Nina: Yeah! Final boss in Iku Turso?
voc_ikuturso_start 3048 Nina: You're...really obsessed with that zone lately.
voc_ikuturso_start 6634 Ichi: [laughs] Coral gyre, yo!
voc_ikuturso_start 9403 Nina: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. My coral gyre's pretty good.
voc_ikuturso_start 14903 Ichi: Yup! I mean, if there's somewhere else you'd rather go, that's cool too.
voc_ikuturso_start 19307 Nina: Aw, that's nice. It's ok though, I like helping you.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 1 Nina: Ugh, yeah... I never know what to wear when I take pictures of myself, though. I get so self-conscious.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 9459 Ichi: You could literally wear anything and I'll probably still like the picture.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 13162 Nina: [nervous laugh] Really? I mean, not *anything*...
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 16960 Ichi: Seriously.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 19838 Nina: Okay. That last one was just of me standing there, so maybe I'll take more of a close-up this time.
voc_ikuturso_whattowear 28589 Ichi: Yes please.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 1 Nina: You've been leading this ampule since it started, right?
voc_ikuturso_ampule 4907 Ichi: No, some other dude was, but he quit... and he was crap anyways. We didn't become good until I whooped everyone's ass into shape.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 13512 Nina: People really do listen to you. It's kind of amazing.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 18268 Ichi: I'm just really straightforward. Like, if people don't listen to me and then they fuck up, I make sure that they know they fucked up. You gotta get in people's faces. That's why they respect me.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 31025 Nina: Haha, I'm glad I haven't messed up that bad yet.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 36913 Ichi: Hah, I'm never gonna yell at you... uh, but still, don't be an idiot.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 42197 Nina: You... wouldn't yell at me?
voc_ikuturso_ampule 44915 Ichi: No!
voc_ikuturso_ampule 46198 Nina: Really?
voc_ikuturso_ampule 47481 Ichi: I'm not gonna yell at a cute girl.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 46198 Nina: [laughs]
voc_ikuturso_ampule 52237 Nina: I'm not cute...
voc_ikuturso_ampule 53671 Ichi: Pfft!
voc_ikuturso_ampule 56691 Nina: Hah, I don't think I am, but that's really nice of you.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 60767 Ichi: Hey, I know what you look like! You've posted a picture of yourself on the forums.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 66277 Nina: I mean, I know. That's a pretty flattering photo though.
voc_ikuturso_ampule 71863 Ichi: You should... send me a different picture, then I can I really decide if I think you're cute!
voc_ikuturso_ampule 76770 Nina: [laughs] Yeaaah...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 1 Nina: I don't know. He's like, attractive... but not really my type, you know?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 6454 Ichi: I don't know, dudes got pecs!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 9561 Nina: [laughs] Ew...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 12722 Nina: I like when guys are more... lean.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 16945 Ichi: Skinny dudes?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 18857 Ichi: I guess I fit that profile.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 20902 Nina: [laughs] I guess so.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 25957 Nina: Hmm...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 28525 Nina: What do you like?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 30437 Ichi: About girls?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 32376 Nina: Yeah.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 34607 Ichi: I... I like... uh, curvy, skinny girls... not like, fat girls. I just like it when they're not like, rail thin, you know? Girls gotta have some meat.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 45070 Nina: [laughs] hmm...
voc_ikuturso_attractive 50937 Nina: I wish I was skinnier.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 53159 Ichi: No way, you'd lose your boobs!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 54937 Nina: [laughs] Uh, I guess so??
voc_ikuturso_attractive 58670 Ichi: Seriously, you have to know that you've got a nice rack - come on!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 62315 Nina: [laughs] I mean, people have told me that before, but -
voc_ikuturso_attractive 68538 Ichi: As they should.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 70493 Nina: [nervous laugh]
voc_ikuturso_attractive 74583 Ichi: Aw, don't know how to take a compliment?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 77338 Nina: [laughs] I really dont.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 80539 Ichi: I'm gonna just have to keep giving you compliments until you get used to it.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 84717 Nina: [laughs] That'd be completely impossible, honestly - but you can give it a shot.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 92539 Ichi: Done!
voc_ikuturso_attractive 93606 Nina: Deal.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 95437 [both laugh]
voc_ikuturso_attractive 98851 Nina: This is the silliest. What are we even doing right now?
voc_ikuturso_attractive 103118 Ichi: Being friends and whacking stuff online.
voc_ikuturso_attractive 106496 Nina: [laughs] True story...
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 1 Ichi: [laughs] Guess you don't want to go waste your money on "Bullshit Hell" tonight?
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 4929 Nina: [laughs] Very funny. I barely even play other games anymore, honestly.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 11700 Ichi: Me neither - they're all crap anyways.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 14787 Nina: It - makes me kind of sad though... I like playing through good story games.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 20038 Ichi: I dunno, those are boring to me. They all have expiration dates - you play for sixty hours and that's it.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 25980 Ichi: At least with this game you can play it for a long time without worrying that you'll have to find some new shit to buy.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 31508 Nina: Yeah, I mean, the time you get out of an online game like this is a lot more...and you get to meet people.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 40767 Ichi: Yeah, I don't like most of the people I meet in here, though. Except for, like, you and a few others.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 47078 Ichi: I just like running shit - like making people get organized for some fight or whatever.
voc_ikuturso_bulldog 51638 Ichi: The big battles where everything's dependent on your ability to find the right guys to do the job - that's what I like.
